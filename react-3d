write software to do this task



1. Read the current attitude from the gyroscope and accelerometer.

2. Calculate the desired reaction wheel angular velocity from the current attitude and the desired attitude.

3. Apply a control law to the reaction wheels to achieve the desired angular velocity.

write c code to do this



1. Read the current attitude from the gyroscope and accelerometer.

float gyro_x, gyro_y, gyro_z;
float accel_x, accel_y, accel_z;

read_gyro(&gyro_x, &gyro_y, &gyro_z);
read_accel(&accel_x, &accel_y, &accel_z);

2. Calculate the desired reaction wheel angular velocity from the current attitude and the desired attitude.

float desired_angular_velocity_x = (desired_attitude_x - current_attitude_x) / reaction_wheel_time_constant;
float desired_angular_velocity_y = (desired_attitude_y - current_attitude_y) / reaction_wheel_time_constant;
float desired_angular_velocity_z = (desired_attitude_z - current_attitude_z) / reaction_wheel_time_constant;

3. Apply a control law to the reaction wheels to achieve the desired angular velocity.

float reaction_wheel_1_torque = desired_angular_velocity_x / reaction_wheel_inertia;
float reaction_wheel_2_torque = desired_angular_velocity_y / reaction_wheel_inertia;
float reaction_wheel_3_torque = desired_angular_velocity_z / reaction_wheel_inertia;

apply_torque_to_reaction_wheel(1, reaction_wheel_1_torque);
apply_torque_to_reaction_wheel(2, reaction_wheel_2_torque);
apply_torque_to_reaction_wheel(3, reaction_wheel_3_torque);
